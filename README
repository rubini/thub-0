This is the "two hour uC board".  I designed it for a conference,
held on 2015-11 in Bozen.

The PCB can plug in a breadboard: the two power pins and the I/O strip
are there to that aim.

It as a atmega/attiny board (i.e. the arduino CPU).  You can fit
attiny48, atmega8, atmega88, atmega168 and atmega328.
If you mount the xtal you can program the fuses for 16MHz operation,
otherwise 8MHz.

Peripherals are:
   - 3 rgb leds
   - one button
   - one output led (on a pwm pin)
   - uext connector (uart, i2c, spi)
   - pin strip for analog
   - pin strip for other I/O pins

There is video of my talk, but I find myself quite boring. Moreover,
the screen is not visible in the video:

After producing 50 and leaving 10 of them to conference attendees, I'm
now using the boards for other stuff, like teaching soldering (where
attendees can keep on device.
